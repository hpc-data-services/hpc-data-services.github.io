## Upcoming BoF at Supercomputing 2019

Distributed data services can enhance HPC productivity by providing
storage, analysis, and visualization capabilities not otherwise present in
conventional parallel file systems. Such services are difficult to develop,
maintain, and deploy in a scientific workflow, however, due to the
complexities of specialized HPC networks, RDMA data transfers, protocol
encoding, and fault tolerance.

This BoF will bring together a growing community of researchers,
developers, vendors, and facility operators who are either using or
developing HPC data services. Participants will share and discuss practical
experiences, implementation examples, new features, and best practices to
construct and deploy production-quality, high-performance distributed
services.

The BoF is held in conjunction with the Supercomputing conference.
The schedule is listed here, see also the following [link][SC19-bof].
